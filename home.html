                <div> I'm a junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science &#128187 and Learning Sciences &#129504.
                    Thanks for stopping by! </div>

        <div class="moreinfo">I probably don't need to explain my Computer Science major, but
            you might be wondering what Learning Sciences entails &#129300. </div>

        <div class="moreinfo">Learning Sciences (LS) explores cognition and design
            with an education lens. My classes feel like a mix of psychology, sociology and teacher
            education, sprinkled with some design and computer science. 
            Interestingly, Northwestern has a great CS + LS PhD program, so many CS professors are also faculty in LS!
            Because of this, I've gotten the chance to work in research&#128200 and even lead my own independent
            project in my interest areas. 
            Feel free to read more about my research in my Projects section &#129299.</div>

        <div class="moreinfo">
            Outside of class, I love to volunteer in my community&#128101. Equity work and community engagement
            are really important to me. I also enjoy exploring Chicago&#127961, event planning, and helping run
             my school's Barstool/Chicks accounts. I am currently reading Victor Ray's
            <i>On Critical Race Theory: Why It Matters and Why You Should Care.</i>
