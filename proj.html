                <div> LumiNUS Tutors (Lumi for short) is a startup organization
                    that provides free mentorship and tutoring to low-income high school
                    students in Chicago. I joined Lumi when it was just an idea. I helped the 3 cofounders
                    develop and complete our first-ever tutor program.

                <div>
                    I helped create a program that matches tutors with students using data
                    structures and algorithms on Python (pandas)
                    to automate the pairing process and create the best possible matches.

                <div> At Comcast, one of the ad hoc projects that I worked on was creating a tool that 
                    searches thousands of Statements of Work and Termination Contracts using keywords.
                    I used Regular Expressions (Reg Ex) in Python to first convert the pdfs to txt 
                    files so that they would be standardized.

                    I'm not sure if I'm allowed to make my code accessible since 
                    it was written when I was working at Comcast, but feel free to ask me
                    about what I did!

                <div> I conducted my own independent research study that investigated how beginner
                    CS (CS1) students perceive professional programmers. Many CS1 students believe
                    that professionals rarely make syntax errors, look up things online, or ask
                    for help, which can affect how they think of <i>themselves</i> as programmers.

                    I analyzed the quantitative data with guidance from my mentor, Dr. Jamie Gorson. 
                    I presented a lightning talk at ICER 2022 and my paper is in press for the SIGCE 2023
                    Student Competition.
