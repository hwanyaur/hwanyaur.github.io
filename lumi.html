            Lumi is a nonprofit organization at Northwestern University that provides free 
            mentorship and tutoring to low-income high school students in Chicago. We are
            currently partnered with Thomas Kelly College Prep HS, Marie Curie Metro HS, 
            and Solorio Academy HS.

            I joined Lumi as a freshman in 2021, when there was no curriculum, students, 
            or tutors. I helped the 3 cofounders develop and complete our first-ever 
            tutor program. I have had a variety of roles (as is common in startups), from
            Partnerships Manager to Tutor Mentor.

            One of the projects I undertook was a student-tutor matching program. 
            As our organization grew, it became increasingly harder to match 
            students and tutors into pairs based off of factors such as time
            availability, mutual languages spoken, and identity. I helped create 
            a program that takes information from surveys and optimizes the matches.
